                Say we have these words: loool and loool. For the letter L we get 2 equals (length).
                This is because both words l indexes are at the exact same position.
                If this wasn't the case, we'd get only 1 if we can find any L in both words.
                For the letter O it's the length 

                The shortest distance to the longest match is self explanatory.
                Basically it finds the fewest steps it took to index the longest match.
